# Experiment - Partition 2

## Description of the Experiment
This experiment was conducted in response to a reviewer's suggestion in our paper, addressing concerns about the partitioning of train and test data potentially affecting the results. To address this, we performed 10 different partitions with randomized users and patients.

## User Partitioning
- **AF train users:** [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19]
- **Non AF train users:** [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
- **AF test users:** [1, 3, 10, 12]
- **Non AF test users:** [3, 5, 8]
